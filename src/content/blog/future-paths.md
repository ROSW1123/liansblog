Decentralized storage of data for security and integrity + Deep Learning with memory and reinforcement learning for flexible pattern learning and recognition.

## Why Decentralized AI

I have been following the news and research by various lab group in the MIT Media Lab. In this year, the focus of the Camera Culture group has officially declared to have two concentrations, for one is decentralized ai. The group already harnessed the technique of split learning and utilized blockchain for data storage and model training. They have achieved great results from it. And, I always appreciate the effort made by the Lab and concern about data security. This combination of technologies is a great surprise with great practicality.
