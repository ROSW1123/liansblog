It was university Freshman year, and I was reading linguistics, philosophy, literature, and mathematics. Before University, I took a gap year to earn the tution for the first year and try to choose a better subject to submerge into for my future potential exploration. So, during my first year, I hope to be able to actually learn new things and consolidate the old, not just crashing courses and exams. But, I was limited by the intuition of the tutors, materials for the curriculum, and the future requirement for my career. 

I have several options for my professional endeavor: Writing, R&D, Developer, and Entrepreneurship. I opted for literature as my major cuz I originally saw the downside of my literacy training should I determined to be a writer for poems or novels, however. I found out creative writing is more about personal determination and lifelong practice, both of which can be and will be carried out by me. (Not interested in a literature teaching role). As for why I chose to be a developer:

I started to code projects since senior high school, with my dell laptop (first laptop) to learn about html,css,and python with FreeCodeCamp and others. Later, after high school, I further explored the programming realm with more frameworks, tools, languages, and computer science. So, I thought, whether I want to be a writer, or a stem field practioner, I can achieve it with a job that can contribute and impact people with technology; with the potential of earning money for various R&D topics contraint-less of funding boundaries. 

Then, I dived into software developement ------------>>>
